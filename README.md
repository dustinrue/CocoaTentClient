Cocoa Tent Client
=================
Cocoa Tent Client is very simple application that exists to assist in the building of an Objective-C based
http://tent.io client library.  When the library is in a more finished state it will be broken out
from this app so that others can make use of it.  

If you want to hack on this client feel free.  In order to use it with your server you will need to edit the tent host url located in the AppDelegate.m file and then compile.  Click register app to register your copy of the app with your server and you should be able to carry on from there.
